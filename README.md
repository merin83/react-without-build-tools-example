# react-without-build-tools-example
A simple Hello React example to show how react.js can be use without any build tools like webpack or any kind of build tools. Using React is very easy which most of us don't know yet. I've tried to put it together what i've learned from the official docs with the below docs reference.

# Reference official React docs

# How to Run
 - clone the repo
 - run your server in this folder
 - check your url
 
# How to Run your server in this folder
you can follow the below wiki from Three.js

# Few Facts
Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
http://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
http://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
