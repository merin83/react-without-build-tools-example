# react-without-build-tools-example
A simple example to show how react.js can be use without any build tools like webpack

### Few Facts
Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
http://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
http://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
